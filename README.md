## 💻 About Me

I'm currently working as a **Cloud & Exchange Administrator at Accenture**, but my journey into tech wasn't a conventional one. I started with a background in **Humanities and Mass Communication**, but my passion for technology led me down a new path. I self-learned cloud technologies and now I'm upskilling further through a **Gen AI and Machine Learning course with IIT Kanpur**.
